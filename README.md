# diygit

Before we got Bitbucket for work, I had no means of doing version control for various scripts for backup, log analysis, server checks, and other automated tasks. I eventually got tired of having to navigate through a morass of "backup.sh.version12345" files, trying to track down a bug. 

Between this and some spare time over the holidays, I whipped up my own version control system, which I called "DIY git". 

Now that we have Bitbucket I don't use this as much, but it's still something I worked hard on.
